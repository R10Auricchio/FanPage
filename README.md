Practice HTML on a favorite Artist

 Step 1
  -You must use semeantic elments to oragnize your HTML, No DIV tags. Use "section" tags if you need a filler.
  -Your page must have navigation links to your artists web page.
  -It must have 2 different lists one ordered and one unordered
  -It must contain at least 3 images that are relevant to your artist.
  -There needs to be either a video embedded or a link created to a video.
  -Include a brief biography.
  -Include how you discovered them and why you like them.
  -Your page should read like a story, a beginnig, middle and end. (header, main, footer)
  
  
 Step 2 (Build a table)
  -Build a table to show upcoming concerts (if there are none, then make up some dates and locations).
  -Each concert should have the following information: Date, Time, Location, Link to buy tickets. (4 columns).
  -The table should have a header and a body (you can create an optional footer if you would like)
  -Display at least 3 concerts.
  
 Step 3 (Build a form)
  -Your form should ask the user at least 4 different questions. For example: What is your favorite song? How many concerts have you been to? How many albums do you own from them? They can be whatever you would like.
